###  Introduction

This is the SNOMED CT implementation guide for FHIR. 

This implementation guide contains (or will, when more work is done):
* mappings from FHIR defined concepts (e.g. codes in code systems, and value sets) to SNOMED CT concepts
* mappings from FHIR resources to the SNOMED CT concept model
* Conformance rules for a FHIR terminology service that provides services for SNOMED CT implementations.

Note, though, that HL7 and SNOMED International may decide to publish some or all of these things elsewhere.

This implementation guide is published by HL7 and SNOMED International jointly, with contributions 
from the National Release Centers, and/or HL7 affiliates. Content in here is the property of either 
HL7 or SNOMED International, and made available to you under different licences.
